\section{DL\_POLY Contribution}

DL\_POLY is a Molecular Dynamics code developed by W. Smith, T.R. Forester and I.T. Todorov at Daresbury Laboratory in Warrington. It is written in Fortran and, before the modifications, included a number of potential types for metals including:

\begin{itemize}
\item Finnis Sinclair
\item EAM
\item EEAM
\end{itemize}

The Finnis Sinclair is a particular form of the EAM potential, and EEAM is a modification where, is the metal is an alloy, the density and embedding functional for each atom type are treated separately.

A meeting was held with Dr. Todorov at Daresbury Laboratory, where a brief overview of the relevant code was given.  After this point, and corresponding by email, the two band EAM type was added (2BEAM).  The code was altered with the addition of an array used to store the d-band density function and d-band embedding functional, with the s-band function/functional using the original density function and embedding functional arrays.  The calculation of energy and forces on atoms was also altered to make use of these arrays where a \acrlong{2beam} potential is used.
