\section{High Performance Computing}

\subsection{Processing and Memory Requirements}

Although DFT calculations already makes a number of approximations to allow their completion in a reasonable timescale, they are still too complicated and resource intensive to run on even high powered home or business computers.  In terms of processing power, what would take weeks to run on a home PC may be completed in a few hours using a high performance computer.  In terms of memory, certain problems would be impractical or impossible on a home PC as they require up to or more than a hundred gigabytes of memory, which is rarely available outside of HPC.



\subsection{HECToR and Archer}

HECToR was a supercomputer located in Edinburgh.  Manufactured by Cray, it was available for scientists to apply for computing time.  Archer replaced HECToR in 2014 and, also manufactured by Cray, is the current leading super computer in the UK.  

\subsection{BlueBEAR}


Brief: throughout the process, DFT, potential fitting and future kmc or MD simulations, need high performance computing.  Time applied for on Archer and BlueBEAR.
