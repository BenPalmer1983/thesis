\section{Materials Developed for Nuclear Power}

With temperatures of several hundred degrees or more, pressures exceeding 150 atomspheres and a high levels of irradiation, $1.0 x10^11$ neutrons per $"cm"^2$ per second, the interior of a nuclear reactor is a hostile and damaging environment.  The choice of material is further complicated due to a number of factors.

\begin{itemize}
\item Isotopes with a high neutron capture cross section that poison the reactor (Xenon-135 and Samarium-149)
\item Limiting creation of hazardous radioactive material in the structural material of the reactor (Cobalt-60)
\item Absorbtion of neutrons by structual material 
\end{itemize}

The environment within the reactor is due to become more hostile as future reactor designs are developed.  A number of reactors will operate at higher temperatures (850 degrees or more) while others are being designed to replace water as a coolant with liquid metal salts.
