\subsection{Bulk Modulus}

This method for calculating the bulk-modulus was used with both for DFT calculations and within the potential analysis code.

A number of homogenous strains (positive and negative) are applied to the relaxed primitive cell.  The energy and volume measurements for each strain are recorded, and a second order polynomial is fit to the data points.  By rearranging the Birch-Murnaghan and either using Levenberg-Marquardt or some similar optimisation technique, the four parameters are fit to the data.  A a maximum strain of a few percent was applied throughout this work.
