Thank you to Brian, Mark and Alessandro for your supervision and support, to my wife Rachel, son Zakk, parents and my family for encouragement.  The various forums in the scientific community, in particular useful discussions with Dr. Todorov of Daresbury and members of the Quantum Espresso forum, have been helpful throughout.  Two teachers in particular from my school days, Mr. George and Mr. Rockett for their encouragement in the sciences, especially Physics.
