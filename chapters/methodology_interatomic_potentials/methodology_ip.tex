Experimental data is available for FCC palladium, but \acrshort{dft} is needed to compute the properties of FCC iron, as it does not exists in this phase at standard conditions without the addition of an austenite stabilizer.  Additional \acrshort{dft} calculations will be used to compute the energy, stress and forces of slightly perturbed atoms which will in turn be used to fit the potentials.

\section{Interatomic Potential Fitting}

The potentials in this work are fitted to both experimental data and DFT data.  As the purpose of these potentials is to provide a way to model Palladium and Ruthenium, and determine whether or not they migrate to the surface, appropriate atomic configurations are included in the fitting process.

The work may be broken into three main parts.  The first is devoted to using DFT to generate the required data, the second is the development of a computer program for fitting the potential, and the third is finally fitting the potential.  An overview of this process is given in figure \ref{fig:workflowpotfit}.

The process follows aspects of previous work.  The force matching method of Ercolessi and Adams\cite{forcematchingmethod} and its application within Brommer's PotFit code\cite{pbrommer} (and it's subsequent extension by Sheng\cite{shengeam}) impacted this work greatly.  The exact fitting methods used by Bonny and spline type functions used throughout work on Iron alloys by Ackland, Mendelev, Hepburn and more helped to fix on a specific form of the functions and functional used here.

\section{Experimental \& DFT Bulk Property Data}

The bulk properties for Fe (\acrshort{bcc}) and Pd are available on several websites and in published work.  The lattice parameter, bulk modulus and elastic constants are available for Fe BCC and Pd FCC, but as pure Fe FCC is theoretical under normal conditions, this is computed here using \acrshort{dft}.


A large amount of computing power is required to run the \acrshort{dft} calculations.  If the input parameters are not accurate enough to begin with, it will either take a long time for the \acrshort{dft} calculation to run, or it will fail to converge completely.  The lattice parameter for each element, using the density of that pure element in its state under normal conditions, is predicted for that element either for both the FCC and BCC structures (table \ref{table:predictedlattice}).

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}
\hline\hline

Aluminium appears here because it has a simpler electronic structure and no magnetic properties to complicate the DFT calculations.  These calculations for Aluminium complete much faster than for the other elements listed, so it was used throughout to develop and test the computer codes created.

\section{DFT Calculations}


\subsection{Quantum Espresso}

There are a choice of several different \acrshort{dft} programs to choose from, including VASP, Siesta and Quantum Espresso.  The open source Quantum Espresso includes the PWscf binary that solves electronic structure calculations with plane wave pseudopotentials.  It calculates the total energy of a system as well as the forces between atoms and the stress on the simulation box.  

As the calculations contain Iron, it is important to take into account the magnetism caused by the filling of the d-shell.  PWscf gives three modes: non-magnetic, collinear spin and non-collinear spin.  



\subsection{Pseudopotential Selection}

The pseudopotentials were downloaded from the Quantum Espresso PSLibrary with url:

http://www.quantum-espresso.org/pseudopotentials/pslibrary 

There are several categories of pseudopotential available.  The pseudopotentials may be fully relativistic or not.  The DFT calculations in this work will be non-spin or collinear spin and the element with the largest number of electrons will be Palladium, with electrons in the s, p, d shells.  There will be no elements used in this work with f shell electrons, so a non-relativistic pseudopoential will be used for each element.

There are a number of choices of exchange-correlation functional, depending on the element:

\begin{itemize}
\item pz: Perdew-Zunger (LDA)
\item vwn: Vosko-Wilk-Nusair (LDA)
\item pbe: Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA)
\item blyp: Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP)
\item pw91: Perdew-Wang 91 gradient-corrected 
\end{itemize}

In the literature, LDA and BLYP are used for organic DFT calculations.  LDA and GGA type pseudopotentials have been used to model solids and, in particular, the GGA type have been used to study metals as they are more reliable at calculating parameters such as $a_0$ (see section \ref{section:ggavslsda}).  Several elements were tested to compare the results of LDA and GGA pseudopotentials to the experimental values for the lattice parameter of each.

The settings used were:

\begin{itemize}
\item ecutwfc: 71 
\item ecutrho: 430 
\item k-points: 9 9 9 Monhurst-Pack grid offset
\item smearing: 0.04 Ry Mazari-Vanderbilt cold smearing
\item calculation type: non-polarised calculation
\item pseudopotentials: PZ for LDA, PBE for GGA
\end{itemize}

The results were computed as follows:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}
\hline\hline
Element & Crystal & $a_0$ exp. (ang) & $a_0$ LDA (ang) & $a_0$ GGA (ang) \\
\hline\hline
Al     & FCC  &  4.05  &  3.98  &  4.04   \\ 
Fe     & BCC  &  2.87  &  2.69  &  2.75   \\ 
Pd     & FCC  &  3.89  &  3.84  &  3.93   \\ 
Cu     & FCC  &  3.61  &  3.49  &  3.59   \\ 
\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Predicted lattice parameters based on the density, atomic number and type of structure}
\label{table:computedlattice}
\end{table}

The simpler LDA pseudopotentials consistently underestimate the lattice parameter $a_0$ for the four metals tested, and on average they underestimate by 3\%.  The GGA calculations are within 1.5\% of the experimental value.


\subsection{Smearing Type}

The material being studied here is a metal/metal alloy, and this has important consquences when setting up the calculation.  The conduction and valence bands overlap in a metal, and the fermi energy passes through this overlap. When the occupied states are summed, integrating over all k-points k\cite{marzarivanderbilt}, those bands that cross the Fermi energy will drop to zero.  There are two solutions used here to reduce this abrupt drop off: increase the number of k-points, or add a smearing to smooth the occupation function.  Previous work has given the following suggested smearing types and values as a start point.

\begin{itemize}
\item Degauss values 0.01Ry Methessel-Paxton \cite{AdsorptionBR2}
\item Fermi-Dirac 0.01eV (0.00074Ry) \cite{NaDiffusion}
\item Marzari-Vanderbilt 0.01Ry \cite{ScBiandYBi}
\item Degauss 0.03 + 0.05 \cite{CuandPd}
\item Marzari-Vanderbilt 0.05Ry \cite{ecHeuslerAlloy}
\end{itemize}

This suggests that a range between 0.01Ry to 0.05Ry should be investigated as a sensible range of smearing energies.  There are a choice of four smearing functions in QuantumEspresso.

\begin{itemize}
\item Gaussian
\item Fermi-Dirac
\item Methfessel-Paxton
\item Marzari-Vanderbilt
\end{itemize}

Functions such as the Gaussian and Fermi-Dirac are not cold smearing, and will converge to the wrong energy whereas the Mazari-Vanderbilt and Methfessel-Paxton are designed to reduce and heating whilst smearing the electron wavefunction.  An author of QuantumEspresso, N. Marzari, co-developed the cold smearing Marzari-Vanderbilt function, and this was selected as it had appeared a number of times in the literature and throughout the QuantumEspresso tutorials.  






\section{Parameter Convergence}

The energy cutoff, charge density, k-point and smearing values must be selected carefully for any similar DFT calculation.  There is a balancing act between the accuracy of the result of a particular calculation and computational time.  This will also vary with the pseudopotential, complexity of the electron configuration of the atoms, whether or not the calculation is with or without spin, and so on.

The pseudopotentials and smearing type have already been selected, and the first set of calculations will not include magnetism.  The parameters must work well with high symmetry geometries, such as a BCC or FCC crystal with the atoms in their exact position, but also where the atoms have been slightly perturbed from their exact position in the lattice.

\subsection{Ecutwfc and Ecutrho}

A primitive FCC or BCC is created and the atoms are slightly perturbed, breaking symmetry but also putting forces on each atom within the cell.  A reasonably high number of k-points are used and the smearing value should be low, but the k-point values in particular will depend upon the computing resources you have available.

Pick a low ecutwfc and set the ecutrho equal to four times the value of the ecutwfc.  Depending on the pseudopotential, the calculation may fail because the values are too small.  If this is the case, continue increasing the value in small (perhaps 5Ry) increments until the calculation runs successfully.

Next, continue to increase the ecutwfc value whilst increasing the value of ecutrho such that $ecutrho = 4 \times ecutwfc$ in steady increments (5Ry).  Once the calculated force and energy per 1Ry increment fall below a threshold set by the user, the values have converged.  In this work, the convergence values were:

\begin{itemize}
\item Energy convergence per 1Ry: $1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ Ry ($1.36 \times 10^{-5}$ eV)
\item Force convergence per 1Ry: $1.0 \times 10^{-5}$ Ry/Bohr ($2.57 \times 10^{-4}$ eV/Ang)
\end{itemize}

At this point, it may be possible to reduce the ecutrho value further while remaining within this convergence threshold, so the ecutwfc value is held fixed while the ecutrho value is reduced in steps of 5Ry.

Finally, attempt to reduce the value of ecutwfc further in 1Ry steps while holding the ecutrho value steady for as long as the convergence value remains within the set threshold.

\subsection{K-Points and Smearing Value}

A configuration with a similar size and number of atoms as those in the calculations should be created.  In this work, the reference database and bulk properties will be calculated using 32 atom configurations in an approximately sized $7 \times 7 \times 7$ angstrom box.  The Iron FCC k-points and smearing are calculated using a 32 atom FCC box with sides length 7.2 angstrom and the Palladium with a 32 atom FCC box with sides length 7.8 angstrom.

As with the ecutwfc and ecutrho convergence calculations, the atoms are slightly perturbed from their exact crystal positions, putting a force on the atoms and breaking the symmetry (as will be the case for the configurations used for fitting). 

The convergence process is more complex for k-points and smearing.  There might be a convergence that, at face value, looks better (a smaller convergence value and a decrease in the computation time and memory requirements) for combinations with a higher smearing value, but it is preferred to have a smaller smearing value with a higher number of k-points, while maintaining a reasonable computing time, as the greater the smearing the further the calculated value is from the actual calculated value (with no smearing and a very high number of k-points).

A 2D plot of energy and force values as a function of number of k-points and smearing may then be used to choose reasonable settings that balance the requirements.


\subsection{Automating Convergence}

The process requires the creation of many input files, and manually editing these files is time consuming and vulnerable to human error. Over 100 input files may be required to converge the ecutwfc and ecutrho values, with a further 50-100 required to generate the 2D k-point and smearing plots.

A python code, QECONVERGE, is developed to automate this process and plot the results automatically for the user (section \ref{code:qeconverge}).

\section{Bulk Property Calculations}

\subsection{QEEOS Python Program}
\label{section:qeeospyprog}

A Python code, QEEOS, (section \ref{code:qeeos}) has been developed to calculate bulk properties of a structure using the \acrshort{dft} code Quantum Espresso.  It is able to fit the equation of state for a cubic structure, and elastic constants for orthorhombic structures (which includes the subset of cubic structures).  In brief, the user provides a template PWscf input file, and the program adjusts the crystal basis vectors, applying the homogeneous strain and 9 distortions required to calculate the equation of state and elastic crystals, as discussed earlier in this work (section \ref{section:calcelasticconstants}).  The output data and highlights of this code are detailed in the results (section \ref{section:resultselastic}) and appendix (\ref{section:qeeosappendix}).


\subsection{DFT Calculations}

Although experimental data does exist for several of the structures, it was decided to calculate all the properties using \acrshort{dft}.  This was partly to confirm that both the QEEOS and PWscf, with the converged settings, were giving reasonable values and also to give data points that would better align with the energy, force and stress configuration calculations.

Experimental data is not available for \acrshort{fcc} Fe and \acrshort{fcc} Ru and so it was essential to compute these.  Although spin collinear equations were used throughout, it was particularly important for these settings to be used for Fe.  The relaxation step allowed for a relaxation of the atom positions, the basis vector and lattice parameter.  This gave cubic structures for Ru and Pd but a tetragonal structure for Fe.

The bulk property calculations were automated with the QEEOS code and this applied the preprogrammed nine strains, as discussed in section \ref{section:calcelasticconstants}, and the results are discussed in chapter \ref{chap:resultsdftdb}. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%%  DFT Reference Database
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{DFT Reference Database}

A database of configurations generated by \acrshort{dft} was compiled for Iron, Palladium, Ruthenium with alloys of Iron-Palladium and Iron-Ruthenium.  The potentials are derived for \acrshort{fcc} Iron and so these configurations were also \acrshort{fcc}.


\subsection{Bulk Property Calculations}

All the configurations in this work are \acrshort{fcc} structure crystals.  The QEEOS program (section \ref{section:qeeospyprog} and \ref{code:qeeos}) was used to compute the relaxed lattice parameter and primitive cell basis vector.

This program also automated the computation of equation of state, bulk modulus and elastic constants.  A 32 atom supercell was used for each pure element where the bulk properties were computed.  Ideally a large supercell or a larger number of k-points would have been used but throughout this work the number of processor cores per node ranged from 20-72 and this along with time constraints limits complexity of the calculations.

The data output from the QEEOS code forms a part of the reference database that is discussed in chapter \ref{chap:resultsdftdb}.



\subsection{Isolated Atom Settings}

\acrlong{dft} solves the Kohn-Sham equations for an infinite repeating lattice, and at first it doesn't seem applicable to single atoms or molecules that are not part of much larger lattice.  There are settings that may be used to compute the energy of an isolated atom and these are discussed on the Quantum Espresso forum\cite{qeforum} and Materials Square\cite{materialssquaresingleatom}. 

The settings of note used in these calculations were a configuration of just 1 isolated atom in a large cubic cell (20+ Bohr).  The computations were all nspin = 2 to ensure the electrons are computed spin up and down.  The assume\_isolated setting is given the makov-payne setting, as the system is a cube.

It was important to reduce the number of processor cores as too many would cause matrix decomposition errors for a low number of atoms, causing Quantum Espresso to crash.  An option to leverage more cores was to split the calculation into pools using the -npool input flag for PWscf, but this was not necessary for this set of calculations.




\subsection{Pure Element Defects}

The potentials are created to apply to \acrshort{fcc} Iron, Palladium, Ruthenium and alloys of Fe-Pd and Fe-Ru.  The configuration database will include several defects:

\begin{itemize}
\item octahedral interstitial
\item tetrahedral interstitial
\item 100, 110 and 111 interstitials
\item crowdion
\item a vacancy
\end{itemize}

The configurations for these defects were estimated using the perfect crystal positions of 2x2x2 supercells containing 32 atoms.  The defect or vacancy was applied, in some cases changing the total number of atoms, and the defect position was estimated.

A number of calculations, and the chance of a successful convergence in both the electronic state \acrshort{scf} calculation and relaxation calculation, were very sensitive on the input parameters.  Aluminium was not as sensitive and was used to relax the starting configuration.  This was then used as the starting point for either Fe, Pd or Ru.

Due to the periodic nature of these calculations, having only 32 atoms was not ideal as each defect cell would be very close to another.  Unfortunately, as stated a number of times, it was a constraint that was needed to be able to complete the work in a reasonable amount of time.

\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Alloy Atom Positions for Pd and Ru}

The stainless steel being studied is to be doped with 1\% or less of a \acrlong{pgm}.  Ideally a super cell with at least 256 atoms (4x4x4 primitive \acrshort{fcc} cells) would be used for all calculations, but due to the complexity of the calculations the majority were 2x2x2 super cells containing just 32 atoms.

\end{figure}

Most of the configurations were prepared using the relaxed \acrshort{fct} structure computed for Fe.  One or more iron atoms were then replaced with either Pd or Ru.  The majority of calculations were carried out using the 32 atom configurations.  The larger 256 atom calculations were better suited to represent the low percentage of \acrshort{pgm} but were only computed using the gamma k-point (figure \ref{fig:binaryalloyconfigurationsbulk}).  This was another compromise in order to complete the calculations in time.



\subsection{Configurations with Randomised Positions}

Many of the atom configurations generated up to this point are symmetric and, whilst they have a variety of energies and stresses to use for fitting, the forces on the atoms are almost balanced and are small or none.  A large set of configurations with positions perturbed slightly from the exact lattice position are created.

Rather than use a linear random distribution a Gaussian distribution is used.  Some atoms had a larger perturbation but the majority are be slightly closer to the exact position, as would be expected with this type of distribution.  The maximum amount of perturbation was selected randomly between a minimum and maximum value.  

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Effect of randomly perturbing atom locations}
\label{fig:pwheatal}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

As the amount at which the atoms are perturbed increases, the energy and total force between the atoms increases.  If the disturbance increases too much, it will likely be useless for our needs as it would be beyond the temperatures relevant to this work, and it may also cause the \acrshort{scf} calculations to fail.

In the case of the alloy configurations, the randomised positions were loaded into the files.  In all cases convergence failed.  As perturbed atom positions had already been computed for Fe a new set of input files were created holding the Fe atoms in their perfect locations.  The added Pd and Ru atoms were then perturbed slightly from their perfect position within the lattice in order to compute forces and energies at slightly different positions.

\subsection{Surface Energy Calculations}

One key aspect of this work is to determine whether or not either Pd or Ru are depleted from the surface at grain boundaries under irradiation.  With this in mind, the surface energies for the pure elements were calculated by creating a slab of atoms with an open surface on each side.

\caption{A sample of configurations used for binary alloy \acrshort{dft} calculations for Fe-Pd and Fe-Ru.}
\label{fig:binaryalloyconfigurationsslab}
\end{figure}

A set of 32 atom configurations are used where the separation between the two facing surfaces is varied.  Several more 128 atom configurations are also prepared for the three pure elements.  To investigate the effect of a small addition of either Ru or Pd in the alloy a slab of Fe was prepared with Ru or Pd either within the slab, at the surface or on the surface (figure \ref{fig:binaryalloyconfigurationsslab}).  These examples were then added into the reference database used to fit the binary potentials.



\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Defects in Fe-Pd and Fe-Ru Alloys}

Attempts were made to compute simple defects in the alloy but the majority failed to converge, either in the electronic structure \acrshort{scf} iteration or a failure to relax geometrically that then lead to a \acrshort{scf} failure.  Rather than focus too much on this, more time was spent investigating Ru and Pd in a slab of Fe where the calculations were more successful.

\section[Issues to Overcome]{DFT Errors, Convergence Failures and Repeat Calculations}

\subsection{Insufficient Memory}

The DFT calculations are performed on a supercomputer with many processors and many cores per processor.  The program uses two implementations of parallelization.

\begin{itemize}
\item OpenMP - many threads have access to the same shared memory
\item OpenMPI/MPICH - many processes, each with it's own memory
\end{itemize}

Whilst some favourable results have been shown using a hybrid of OpenMP and OpenMPI, it was more straightforward to use in OpenMPI mode only in this work.  Unfortunately, the amount of memory per process overwhelmed the computing nodes for certain calculation.  The job script was modified to reserve entire nodes and all the memory on each node, but to only use the cores on one of the two processors to halve the processes per node, but double the memory per process.  It was quicker to do this than wait in the high memory queue on BlueBEAR, where the memory per process would be perhaps double than that required.

\subsection{Scratch Restrictions}

When the calculations first started, the scratch space was located on a large shared space on the BlueBEAR computer.  Over time the drive space quota was restricted and the scratch was relocated to individual nodes.  There were few issues with less complex calculations as the \acrshort{scf} temporary data was several GB in size with the scratch space on each node being approximately 120GB.  Once a batch of collinear iron calculations had been submitted to the job queue, they would quickly fill the scratch drive and the job would terminate after just a few calculations, as the node had run out of scratch drive space.

\end{lstlisting}

As the convergence and equation of state/elastic constant python programs automatically created and submitted the PWscf jobs, they would need to be continually restarted after clearing out the scratch.  To work around this a batch script (listing \ref{listing:sbatchfile}) and wrapper script (listing \ref{listing:wrapperfile}) for pw.sh were written.  The batch script sets the environment variables required for the sbatch job scheduling program and the wrapper script, and the wrapper script then clears the scratch directory before running PWscf.


\subsection{Caching Repeat Calculations}

Several of the programs required many hundreds of DFT calculations.  At first, if an error was encountered and the program had to start from scratch, computation time would be wasted.  To solve this, a directory was set to cache input and output files for PWscf.  A hash would be generated from the input file and this would be used as the cache file name.  If a calculation was successful, it would save the input and output file.  In future, if the same calculation was submitted again, the cached file would be returned.  The cache could be copied from BlueBEAR to other computers to save on repeat submission to the BlueBEAR job scheduler.


\subsection{Not Straying Too Far From Reality}

It is important to provide the calculation with reasonable and realistic configurations and settings.  Where a pure element such as Aluminium, Iron or Platinum was being investigated, the known experimental lattice parameters were used as a starting point (table \ref{table:predictedlattice} and table \ref{table:computedlattice}).  If the parameters were too far from these values, for example inputting a lattice parameter of either 2 or 8 angs for Aluminium rather than 4, as a starting approximation, the DFT calculation might struggle to relax the structure, or to even successfully run or converge a calculation.

The FCC Iron structure lattice parameter was estimated from the density of FCC steel, and the lattice parameter for alloys could similarly be estimated within a reasonable margin to use as a start point for the calculation.



\subsection{Adjustment of DFT Parameters}

Throughout the DFT segment of this work, there were a number of issues that either resulted in the calculations failing or completing and not converging.  There were a number of causes for this and several solutions were used throughout the process to converge the \acrshort{scf} calculation.

Where the ecutwfc and ecutrho parameters are not converged there is a danger that values too low therefore containing too few plane waves in the basis set.  This might cause problems with the \acrshort{scf} causing it not to converge.  The same can be said about a failure to pick appropriate k-points and smearing.

There are a selection of mixing modes available in PWscf, giving a choice of Thomas-Fermi screening for homogeneous systems, local density dependent Thomas Fermi (local-TF) screening for inhomogeneous screening and Broyden mixing as the default.  

\begin{figure}[htb]

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Fe-Ru calculations failed to converge in 100 iterations when plain mixing was used, but achieved convergence in under 40 iterations with local-TF convergence}
\label{fig:failuretoconverge}
\end{figure}

For calculations with defects the local-TF setting was used and for equation of state and elastic constant calculations, where the distribution of atoms is more homogeneous, plain Broyden mixing was used.  In most circumstances the mixing factor (mixing\_beta) was reduced to 0.1.  This wasn't always the case, and for certain defect calculations the default value of 0.3 proved to be the more efficient choice.

One other important parameter, that primarily affects geometry and position relaxation calculations (VC-RELAX), was the convergence threshold for the SCF calculations (conv\_thr).  The default value is $1.0\times 10^{-6}$ Ry and this was sufficient for SCF calculations and most VC-RELAX calculations.  Several relaxation calculations failed to converge and, at the suggestion of authors of Quantum Epresso, the threshold was reduced to $1.0\times 10^{-7}$ Ry.  This would lead to a longer time to compute the first geometry optimisation step.  As this result affects future steps the success of convergence for subsequent steps and the time taken to complete the optimisation was reduced. 



\subsection{Trial Parameters for Iron with and Octahedral Defect}

Calculations where there is a high level of symmetry finished relatively quickly and without much trouble.  Where the position of each atom was perturbed slightly or where there was a defect the \acrshort{scf} calculations would take more iterations to converge and would often fail completely.  Where the geometry and atom position was also being optimised through repeated sets of \acrshort{scf} iterations the calculation would begin to converge but would ultimately fail through \acrshort{scf} non convergence.

\caption{Improving convergence SCF calculations of defects in Iron}
\label{table:trialparametersocta}
\end{table}

Iron with an octahedral defect was used to help fine tune parameters.  Initially a set of \acrshort{scf} calculations were performed with different parameters, and finally these were used to relax the cell geometry and atom positions for this defect.

Changing the number of k-points did not have an impact on the number of iterations required to converge, but changing the smearing value did.  An increase in smearing would be detrimental to the accuracy of convergence to the correct value and by doing this it would cause a difference in energy between past calculations with a smearing of 0.04Ry and and those with 0.07Ry.

The adjustment that had the largest impact on reducing the number of iterations was the change from plain mixing to Local-TF.  Following this, using a mixing beta of 0.3 where more weight is given to the previous state, also helped to reduce the number of iterations.

The attempts to optimise the values was not exhaustive as there were constrictions on time.  However, despite making these improvements and reducing the convergence threshold to $1.0 \times 10^{-8}$, the cell geometry and position relaxation of the starting configuration for an octahedral defect (by adding an atom at the octahedral location) also fails to relax by \acrshort{scf} non-convergence within an iteration of the relaxation algorithm. 

The optimization of the geometry and atom positions was likely due to it being a complex system to model with the initial configuration too far from the relaxed one.  To work around this the octahedral defect for a more simple metal, Aluminium, was relaxed to give a better starting point for the Iron calculation.  The increase in cell size was also applied.  With a better initial configuration and the adjusted parameters, the Iron octahedral calculation successfully completed.

This process was repeated for tetrahedral, 100, 110, 111 and crowdion defects.

\section[EAMPA]{EAMPA: Potential Analysis and Fitting Code}

A python-fortran based computer code was developed to fit interatomic potentials to bulk properties and DFT calculated forces and energies.  It has been designed to take advantage of both Fortran and Python.  Fortran is used to compute the neighbour lists, energies, stresses and forces, and Python is used to read and write data, produce plots and control the potential fitting.  This allows the use of custom optimization subroutines as well as the use of those included in the SciPy module.  Highlights from the code are discussed in the results (section \ref{code:eampa}) and the appendix of this work (appendix \ref{chapter:appendix-eampa}).

\section[Potential Transferability]{Investigating the Transferability of Existing Potentials}

There are currently a number of \acrshort{eam} Iron potentials, as well as a \acrshort{meam} potential for Fe-Pd.  Several pure element potentials also exist for Ruthenium and Palladium.  Whilst it would be convenient to have a one size fits all potential, this is not the case.  Taking the Ruthenium potential as an example, in work that required the reproduction of stacking fault and surface energy of the element, the existing potentials were inadequate and a new potential was developed\cite{mendelevruau}.

Several potentials were selected to test transferability.  First, the FCC Sheng potential for Aluminium was applied to both FCC and BCC structures in the EAMPA code.  The properties of FCC Aluminium are known, and those for BCC Aluminium were calculated using DFT.  This investigation shows that some properties, such as the lattice constant, does transfer quite well to the new structure, but the bulk modulus and $C_{11}$ elastic constant are both poorly reproduced (table \ref{table:alshengtransferability}).

\label{table:alshengtransferability}
\end{table}

The Mendelev 2003 potential was developed to fit the properties of BCC Iron, but also to reproduce the transition from BCC to FCC at high temperatures.  However, when using this potential for low  temperature FCC Iron, it does not reproduce the properties predicted by DFT.  All 9 orthorhombic elastic constants have been omitted in table \ref{table:femendelevtransferability}, but there is a significant difference for the three elastic constants given as well as the bulk modulus.

\end{table}

Finally the Ackland 1997 potential for Iron was tested.  This older potential gives a better value for the cohesive energy when transferred to the FCC structure, but other properties such as the relaxed lattice constant are quite different (table \ref{table:feacklandtransferability}).

\end{table}

This investigation into existing potentials shows that whilst some of the properties are replicated, many do not match the DFT computed values.  This supports the derivation of new potentials to be fit that replicate the DFT values and take into account the characteristics of a number of provided configurations.  Additional plots are included in the appendix that show the expected equations of state compared to those generated using the above potentials (section \ref{section:transferabilityappendix}).




\section{Fitting Potentials with EAMPA}

The custom computer code EAMPA was developed in order to fit the parameters for the potentials to the \acrshort{dft} reference database.  It was a long process that utilised nodes on the University of Birmingham BlueBEAR computer.  At the time of writing, the code was able to fit energy, forces and bulk properties.  I was not convinced that the computation of stress in EAMPA and in PWscf were identical and so throughout I set the weighting of stress to zero.

\subsection{Choice of Function and Functional}

A number of functions and functionals have been used previously and these are discussed in detail in chapter \ref{chap:backgroundfitting}.  Several were used to attempt to fit the potentials, but eventually the cubic splines and tight binding type functional, as used by Mendelev, Ackland, Bonny et al, were selected.

Initially, I looked to the computer program DIRAC for the density function, as it computes the radial electron density distribution (figure \ref{fig:dirac-fe-density-plot} and figure \ref{fig:dirac-fe-density-plot}).  Unfortunately, as may be expected, there were a number of issues in using the density distribution of a single atom.  The atomic separation for both iron and palladium, for a relaxed crystal, begins at approximately 2-2.5 angstrom, but most of the electrons, from all shells, are distributed much closer.  The plot does not take into consideration the valence electrons shared in the crystal, bonding the metal atoms together.

From the point of view of the potential, the pair potential will dominate at small separations due to the \acrshort{zbl} function.  The density function will be important at separations of 2 angstrom up to the cutoff radius (5-6 angstrom).  For this reason, the idea to use the DIRAC computed densities was abandoned in favour of a cubic spline.

\begin{figure}[htb]

  \label{fig:dirac-pd-density-plot}
	\end{center}
\endminipage
\end{figure}

One interesting feature that Bonny used in his code was to add a hard core spline to the pair potential with a positive coefficient.  This was to ensure that at small separations, say below 1.5-1.8 angstrom, the atoms would repel.  The cubic spline used in this work for the density also has a fixed positive coefficient to help stop negative densities for small separations.  This is dependent on the number of cubic splines used, and is a feature that can be turned off in the EAMPA code.

A cubic spline was also used for the pair potential, and as with Bonny's code, this had a hard core potential but in addition to this a \acrshort{zbl} core was added to the entire potential to ensure the exponential increase in energy as modelled with the \acrshort{zbl} function.  This was to ensure the potential would both model the material when out of a radiation field, where the atoms are several angstrom apart, but also able to capture a damage cascade where the separation drops and the \acrshort{zbl} becomes the dominant feature, over both the pair cubic spline and the embedding functional.

There was a choice of several embedding functionals but one based on the Finnis-Sinclair and \acrshort{eam} was used.  It consisted of the square root term but also a zeroth power and square term for greater flexibility.  The addition of a fourth power term had been trailed, but occasionally when fitting the parameters the coefficient of the fourth power would become negative leading to a negative energy at high electron densities.


\subsection{Searching Parameter Space}

Improving the potential was an iterative process that required multiple runs of EAMPA feeding the last potential as a starting point for the next potential.  In the first instance, the exact bulk property fitting code of Bonny was used, but it did not always find the parameters that reproduced the data points it was given.  This was perhaps due to a lack of data and knowledge on how to use the code effectively, but it did give a starting point with a modest number of cubic splines for the density and pair functions.

These initial set of parameters were then used with EAMPA.  The first task with this code was to find parameters that replicated the energies, forces and bulk properties for each of the pure elements.

The type of search could be adjusted for each fitting job, but the typical process was as follows.  A short random search through parameter space followed by a small simulated annealing search with a wide search area.  This was then followed by a genetic algorithm search with quite a wide search area.  Next a second genetic algorithm search over a smaller range of parameters but with more iterations and a larger population, and this step used most of the computation time.  Finally a short simulated annealing and local \acrshort{bfgs} minimizer were used before outputting optimised parameters.  A sample input is given in listing \ref{lst:searchsettings}, but the user is free to add fewer or more steps and search types.

The code has an option to set the random seed such that every job with that seed and settings will return the same output.  This allowed ten or more jobs to be run in parallel, with 4 cores per job, and a different seed for each job.  Typical run times were 3-5 days per iteration and several iterations required.

At the start of the fitting process all available configurations were used, but it turned out to be difficult for the code to satisfy all the constraints given the simplicity of the \acrshort{eam} potentials.  Towards the end of the process many of the configurations were removed with bulk and surface/slab configurations being left.  This was in order to train the potential specifically to these configurations in favour of the entire set.  

Once the pure potentials for Fe, Pd and Ru were determined, they each underwent an effective gauge transform, with the transform being that used by Bonny et al\cite{bonnyfecr}\cite{bonnymalerba}.  Due to this transform, they were converted from analytic potentials to numeric.  

The fixed numeric functions were then used in the binary alloy fitting where the only parameters adjusted are those for the cross pair potential.  The searching method was similar to that used for the pure elements, but the configurations were changed to those containing both species of atom.  The bulk property fitting was also removed as this fitting was only applicable to the pure elements.



\section{DL\_POLY Contribution}

DL\_POLY is a Molecular Dynamics code developed by W. Smith, T.R. Forester and I.T. Todorov at Daresbury Laboratory in Warrington. It is written in Fortran and, before the modifications, included a number of potential types for metals including:

\begin{itemize}
\item Finnis Sinclair
\item EAM
\item EEAM
\end{itemize}

The Finnis Sinclair is a particular form of the EAM potential, and EEAM is a modification where, is the metal is an alloy, the density and embedding functional for each atom type are treated separately.

A meeting was held with Dr. Todorov at Daresbury Laboratory, where a brief overview of the relevant code was given.  After this point, and corresponding by email, the two band EAM type was added (2BEAM).  The code was altered with the addition of an array used to store the d-band density function and d-band embedding functional, with the s-band function/functional using the original density function and embedding functional arrays.  The calculation of energy and forces on atoms was also altered to make use of these arrays where a \acrlong{2beam} potential is used.

\subsection{Potential Functions \& Functionals}

There are a large number of functions and functionals used in the literature, and the potentials provided by H. Sheng are numeric\cite{shengeam} (section \ref{section:shengeampotentials}).  In this work, it was decided to use a knot-to-knot spline for the pair potential that is attached to a ZBL potential for small separations, with a fixed node at the cutoff, with a zero value and gradient.  In the first instance the radial electron density was calculated using DIRAC and from this a knot-to-knot spline was fitted with a forced cutoff to $\rho(r_{cut}) = 0, \rho'(r_{cut}) = 0$.  This was then replaced with a knot-to-knot spline based on the Sheng density potentials and the reason for this will be discussed in section \ref{section:diracdensityplots}. Finally, the embedding functionals take the form $f(x) = p(1) \times \sqrt{r} + p(2) \times r^2$ as used by Mendelev\cite{femendelev}\cite{feacklandmendelev}, Ackland\cite{feacklandmendelev}, Olsson\cite{olssonfecr} and Wallenius\cite{olssonfecr}.

\subsubsection{Sheng Potentials}

The Sheng potentials available are numeric and so the functions used in this work were first fit to the tabulated data\cite{shengeamonline}.  As the Sheng Pd is a potential for a \acrshort{fcc} crystal, this was a starting point for both Fe and Pd (which is quite obvious for the case of Pd).  Plot for the Pd potential are given in figs. \ref{fig:shengpdpair} \ref{fig:shengpdpairzoom} \ref{fig:shengpddens} \ref{fig:shengpdembe}.
