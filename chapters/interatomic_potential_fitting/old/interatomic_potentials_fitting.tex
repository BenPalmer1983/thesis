\section{Fitting Interatomic Potentials}

\subsection{Analysing a Potential}

To fit a potential, it must be analysed as it is changed by comparing the behaviour of a model using this potential to experimental or DFT derived values.  The properties and values being compared in this thesis are:

\begin{itemize}
\item total energy of a collection of atoms
\item forces between a collection of atoms
\item bulk modulus, optimum energy and volume for an FCC crystal structure
\item $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$ and $C_{44}$ elastic constants
\end{itemize}
