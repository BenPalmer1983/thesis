\abstractpreamble{The aim of the first part of this work was to derive an equation capable of calculating the radioactivity of an isotope and all the subsequent isotopes in the decay chain, taking into account branching factors and source terms.  This was achieved and a computer code was developed in Fortran to predict the radioactivity of a target irradiated by an ion beam.\\
\\
The equation has been written into several Python 3 functions and a second code was developed to estimate radioactivity of a thin foil irradiated by neutrons passing through perpendicular to the plane of the foil.}
