\abstractpreamble{Several generation III+ nuclear reactors have been proposed for construction in the UK and generation IV nuclear reactors being researched and developed.  New materials are required to withstand the extreme conditions in and around the core of these reactors.  Austenitic stainless steels have been an important structural material in the industry, and may continue to be so, providing the problem of Intergranular Stress Corrossion Cracking (IGSCC) can be addressed.  Doping these steels with platinum group metals has been seen to reduce IGSCC, but the effects are unknown for these steels in a radiation field.}
