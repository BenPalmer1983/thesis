\abstractpreamble{There are a wide range of radiation sources and types of ionising radiation.  They interact differently with matter, depending on the type of radiation and its energy.  Damage may be caused directly, and target material may be changed chemically, for example water radiolysis, or transmuted, for example the creation of Cobalt-60 in steel in the nuclear industry.}
