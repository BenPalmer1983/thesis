\section{Fortran}

There are a wide range of programming languages to chose from, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.  At the time of writing, and out of the choice of Python, C++ and Fortran, the latter was selected.

Fortran is a compiled language that gives the developer direct control over memory allocation.  Arrays of a reasonable size, approximately 8MB, may be stored in the stack memory, and for slower operations much larger arrays may be stored in the heap memory.  In this respect, it is an unforgiving language as the developer must allocate and free memory correctly or risk segmentation faults.

Many modern computers, and all super computers, are multicore/multiprocessor machines.  The OpenMP and OpenMPI libraries (and variants) allow programs to be developed to easily take advantage of parrallel programming.  OpenMP allows multiple threads to access the same memory,
