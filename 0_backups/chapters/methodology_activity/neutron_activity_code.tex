\section{Activation by Neutron Irradiation}

\subsection{Introduction}

A short program was created, based on the existing code developed to calculated ion activation.  It is a simple non-transport neutron activation code, used to estimate the activity and subsequent cooling of materials irradiated by neutrons.  A single energy neutron flux or Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution may be selected by the user and the TENDL-2019 data file is used to provide cross sections for calculating reaction rates.  Finally, the previously derived extended Bateman equations are used to calculate isotopes at time t after irradiation begins.
