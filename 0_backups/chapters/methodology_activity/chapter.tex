\subsection{Introduction}


High flux neutron reactors are expensive to use, whereas proton accelerators capable of producing beams of adequate fluence and energy are more readily available, cheaper to buy and cheaper to run.  Ion beams are more controlable, and may be concentrated on a desired target at a set fluence and energy.

Depending on the energy of the ion beam, the target material will become radioactive.  An equation was derived to predict the
