\chapter{Background: Proton Activation and Radioactive Decay}

\abstractpreamble{Where proton or deuteron radiation is used to emulate neutron damage, there is still an associated risk of transmuting atoms in the target material, creating radioactive isotopes.  An equation was derived to calculate the radioactivity of each element in the decay chain.  It takes into account a source term for each isotope in the decay chain, as well as any branching factors.\\
Once derived, the equation was used in a computer code that, coupled with cross section data from the TENDL library and ion transport data from the SRIM ion transport code, predicts the radioactivity of a sample.}
