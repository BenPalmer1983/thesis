\abstractpreamble{Austenitic stainless steels have played an important role in the nuclear industry.  They have a good resistance to corrosion and behavior well at moderately high temperatures, having a good resistance to creep.  In has been used within the primary circuit and secondary circuit of power stations, as cladding for fuel pellets, in the steam dryers, preheater tubing, core structurals, primarty piping and more.}
